  <h1>Technical Blog: How dope is Scope?</h1>
  <h2><em>February 10, 2017</em></h2>
  </div>

<div class="container">
  <h4>For the non-techies. What is scope and what does it mean for Javascript code?</h4>
  <p>In Javascript there are two types of scope. Global and local. There are also nested functions which we get to later. To describe this system, I use my (very) basic (and hopefully correct) understanding of law in countries that consist of states.</p>
  <p>
    In Javascript, we define variables that can be used throughout our script. This is often used to save time and make code simpler. For instance, I might set the value of 6783829 to the variable a. I would do this using the line <em>var a = 6783829</em> I could then reuse <em>a</em> to represent 6783829 throughout the rest of my code as long as the variable is set within a global scope. Comparing this a country like the US, this would like be setting a law in the senate that would apply to all states within the country. This variable is now applicable all throughout the script.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, just like there are separate states within a country, there are functions in Javascript. Functions are blocks of code that can be reused, and just like the laws of a state, the variables defined within a function will only be recognised inside of that function and nowhere else. We call this Local Scope.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, Nested Functions are what happens when we place a function inside of another function. Again the same trend follows. Variables on the outside of this nested function can be accessed from within the nested function, but from outside the nested function, we can not access variables located from within. In other words, we can look out the window of our scope to find variables, but unfortunately, the glass is tinted and we can not look inside.
