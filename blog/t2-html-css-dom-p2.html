<h1>Technical Blog - Part 2</h1>
<h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
    <p>
      Grid based design is a highly-effective approach to organising content on your page through the use of a grid system. Effective grid systems divide the webpage up into 12 columns through the use of CSS. 12 columns are seen as the most effective way to divide up the page as the number 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 6 and itself. Compared to other numbers, this is highly divisible. Through this system, it is easier for the developer to anchor content to the desired area of the page.
    </p>
  <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
  <p>
    Responsive web design is becoming increasingly important as more people begin to experience the web through the use of multiple and different sized devices. Because of this, it is highly important a website can effectively display in a way that supports all screen sizes and types.
  </p>

  <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
    <p>
      "Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look." (Wikipedia.org).<p>

    <p>
      In basic terms, semantic structure in HTML is about using tags that emphasise the meaning of certain elements you want to display. For instance, an h1 tag, will be used on text that you wish to emphasise as a main header for a webpage.
    </p>

  <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h2>
  <p>
    The next idea I want to look into, is to see if it is possible to crop images to the size you want using code, or whether you have to do that using graphic design software.
