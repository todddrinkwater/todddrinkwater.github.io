  <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
  <p>
    This evening I decided to practice mindfulness conversation with my girlfriend, Megan. From it, we both agreed that it was effective in allowing for one to analyse the conversation topic, ideas, and feelings about it. For Megan, it was helpful to her in problem-solving. By talking uninterrupted for 3 minutes, she was able to outline her ideas for how to approach her Year 11 Drama programme planning for the year and her feelings about it. For me, it was good to be able to blow off a bit of steam by talking about my frustrations and challenges in this weeks sprint. We both agreed that by acknowledging our feelings it was therapeutic.
  </p>
  <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
  <p>
    The technique I will focus on is dipping. This is, acknowledging my feelings about what the speaker is saying, and then letting them go in a non-judgemental way. The main reason I have to choose to use this is that I am aware that I can often respond to people in ways that are not always neutral and this can affect how open someone feels about sharing their ideas with me. Improving on this, I believe, will help me to have more meaningful conversations in the future.
