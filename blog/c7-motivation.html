  <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
  <p>
    The idea of pleasure, passion and purpose and its relationship with motivation is an insight provided by LinkExhange founder Tony Hsieh. Hsieh believes pleasure, passion and purpose all affect levels of motivation in different ways, and with different levels of sustainabilty.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Pleasure</em></strong> I would most likely compare to a can of soda. It is something that can give a short-term high but then you quickly crash and are left waiting for the next rush. When it comes to work pleasure, is viewed as something that makes you feel really good about what you do, but that level of happiness and motivation is highly unsustainable. One example would be recieving a pay rise. While in the short-term this may increase motivation, this is quickly out-lived and can leave an employee wanting more money in order to seek the same amount of satisfaction from their work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Passion</em></strong> is another name for flow, a term coined psychologist â€ŽMihaly Csikszentmihalyi to describe a feeling of intense focus, enjoyment and engagement when performing an activty. Work that are skilled in, but also find challenging often creates the conditions for expriencing flow. When in flow, time can fly by and levels of productivity rise. Compared to pleasure, this is a more sustainable form of motivation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Purpose.</em></strong> Having purpose in your work and life is not only linked to high, sustainable levels of motivation, but also general happiness in ones own life. Purpose is about feeling apart of something bigger than yourself. That means, if you feel your work is meaningful, you will more feel likely feel more motivated towards it, and in a way that is sustainable.
  </p>
  <h3>Core values</h3>
    <p>
      <strong><em>What are your core values? What do you stand for?</em></strong> The core values I identify with have to do with the betterment of the environment, other people, and oneself. All three of these are interrelated and they both support, and rely on, one another. If we take the time to take care of ourselves, we can then more able to assist others and take care of our environment. In saying this however, it is important we take care of others and our environment as these also play a important part in our our happiness.
