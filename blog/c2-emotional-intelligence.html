  <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Learn to listen to your body - By learning how your body responds to certain emotions you can create a better awareness of them. By being more aware of our emotions we can learn more effectively manage them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Emotional intelligence is important for leadership. Emotional competencies "make up to 80 to 100 percent of the distinguishing compentencies of outstanding leaders.
    </li>
    <li>
      4 out of the 6 six competencies that help engineers to excel in their jobs are emotional competencies. These were: strong achievement drive and high achievement standards, ability to influence, initiative in taking on challenges, and self-confidence.
    </li>
    <li>
      Those that performed attention training with mindfulness, were more likely to react more calmly in high stress situations. With the amygdala response in the brain being downgraded it allows us to more successfully make clear and informed decisions.

  <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
  <p>
    The two minutes of mindfulness was much more difficult then what I had first thought it would be. Trying to not become distracted by not only outside noises, but your own thoughts was tricky to overcome. Sounds of cars driving past and thoughts of what I should or should not be thinking at the present moment, crept their way in. Having the approach of letting thoughts come in, acknowledging the, and then gently guiding them out helped to improve focus on breathing, as well as did the breathing itself. After the two minutes I felt refreshed and more focused when typing my answer to this question.
