  <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
  <p>
    Self-Regulation is defined as "the process of managing one's internal states, impulses and resources [for the process of performing optimally]." Compared to mindfulness, which is "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose in the present moment and non-judgementally" (Jon Kabat-Zinn) they are both similar. Mindfulness aims to focus on the homoeostasis of your emotional systems, and self-awareness is learning how to keep them in-check by understanding your body's responses to particular events.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, in a situation of confrontation, mindfulness allows one to become aware of certain emotions (such as anger) that may arise by paying attention to the body's responses in that situation (e.g. face getting red, short breaths). With Self-Awareness, however, we learn how to become more aware of these emotions, while learning how to manage them in a more logical way instead of our letting emotions take control of us.
  </p>
  <h3> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
  <p>
      My experience of the body scan exercise was interesting. I felt it brought attention to the different aspects of my body. For one, when I brought attention to my muscles I felt them start to relax. I also noticed that when thinking of positive emotions, the feeling in my muscles became different again - although I find it hard to explain what that feeling was.
  </p>
  <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
  <p>
    From this section, I took away the idea that our emotions are psychological phenomena, rather than who we are. For example, in the instance of feeling angry - acknowledging that you are experiencing anger rather than thinking "I am angry" allows us to separate from our emotions. By doing this, we allow ourselves to manage our emotions more logically and with choice.Â
