<h3>What is a responsive website? Why is it important?</h3>
<p>
  A responsive website is one that can respond to all media screen types and sizes. A responsive website is important these days due to the the internet being accessed through mutliple platforms.
</p>

 <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>
  <p>
    Mobile first design refers to planning for mobile screen sizes first, and then building the rest of the website on this afterwards. This is important for two key reasons. Firstly, it is easier to build a mobile based site first, and then build on this. Having a complex, desktop sized site and then trying to collapse this however, is much more difficult. Secondly, more people access the web these days on mobile devices then any other, hence making it an essential display platform to get right.

 <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/what-are-frameworks-22-best-responsive-css-frameworks-for-web-design.html" title="awwwards.com">awwwards.com</a> defines frameworks as a "standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature." In simpler terms, Frameworks can be a set of code that we can reference to help make our websites look and function in a certain way. Some of the pros of using frameworks are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Time Saving - because most of the code is already there. It can save large durations of time that could be better spent on other aspects of your website.</li>
      <li>Security - with a community behind it there's more chance others have picked up on any vunerabilities and have fixed it.</li>
      <li>Cost - Most well-known frameworks are free</li>
      <li>Support - Large frameworks often come with community of helpers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cons
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>More time spent learning the Framework instead of the language.</li>
      <li>The frameworks core behaviour can often not be modified. Meaning your having to work within the rules of the framework.</li>
      <li>Public code means others can study it and find loopholes in it. This could be used against you to expose the flaws in your website.</li>
    </ul>

 <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
<p>
  Wireframes are template drawings used to work out how to position elements throughout your webpage and gain an overall idea of how it will look. These templates can be drawn on paper or using design software. Wireframes are a crucial part of design and should be implemented before you code any part of your webpage or website.

<h3>What I found difficult about wireframing</h3>
<p>The part about wireframing that I found difficult was, first of all, how to put what I envisiged down on paper. Not only did I have to consider how the page would be most aesthetically pleasing, I also had to make sure that it would be practical to code as well. Secondly, I had to consider what was the most important content I needed to get across the user, and how could I make sure they would not be distracted by this. This lead to a minimalist design only displaying my name, navigation and social media buttons.</p>
