How did the process over product concept affect the way you tackled the website?

Probably one of the biggest challenges for me, it overcoming the desire to perfect the final product. For me this week it was me trying to create a dropdown menu for my websites navigation bar. I didn't want to change this as this was a essential part of my websites final design and something I had planned from the start in my wireframes. While I continued to be resilent and looked for answers throughout the internet. This quickly became a big problem, and something I wasted an entire day on solving with little luck of getting the solution I wanted. Next time, I will need to timebox myself to complete certain tasks in a given time and move on to something else if I find myself getting blocked.
