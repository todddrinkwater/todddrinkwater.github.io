  <h1>The Meditation Process</h1>
  <h3><em>December 19, 2016</em></h3>
  </div>

  <h3>How did the process over product concept affect the way you tackled the website?</h3>

  <p>Probably one of the biggest challenges for me, it overcoming the desire to perfect the final product. For me this week it was me trying to create a dropdown menu for my websites navigation bar. I didn't want to change this as this was a essential part of my websites final design and something I had planned from the start in my wireframes. While I continued to be resilent and looked for answers throughout the internet. This quickly became a big problem, and something I wasted an entire day on solving with little luck of getting the solution I wanted. Next time, I will need to timebox myself to complete certain tasks in a given time and move on to something else if I find myself getting blocked.</p>

 <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
 <p>
   Before reading about Chapter 2, I was somewhat skeptical about what the benefits of meditation and how it was beneficial. Normally, because I am a calm person, I didn't neccessarily feel the need for it. However, I was willing to approach it with an open mind.
 </p>
 <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
 <p>
   I loved the analogy that compared Meditation to a Snow Globe. It refered to a cluttered mind being like a Snow Globe shaken up, and a calm mind being one when the snow has settled. This is what meditation hopes to achieve. It order to achieve this, Chade-Meng Tan refered to meditation being like riding a bike and that we are constantly correcting ourselves to remain focused and away from distraction. Another important thing that was mentioned is that those who practice meditation regularly have also proven to have better immunity to strains of certain viruses (e.g. influenza).
 </p>

 <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
  Chade-Meng Tan mentions is that when we meditate we do not have to resort to traditional postures if we do not wish to. The main important thing is that we have a posture that allows us to be relaxed but alert at the same time.
