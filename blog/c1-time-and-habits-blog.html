  <h1>Time and Habits Blog</h1>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>

      <h4>Which timebox and habits technique did you try?</h4>
      <p>The five resources I looked at were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Power of Meditation</li>
        <li>How Mindfulness Can Improve Productivity, Focus, and Work Life Balance</li>
        <li>Habits & Growth Mindset</li>
        <li>Pomodoro Technique - focus on one thing for 25 minutes then take a five minute break</li>
        <li>The Habits of Successful People: They Start Small</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
      <p>One the articles I found most interesting was <em>"Habits & Growth Mindset".</em>This article challenged the belief of having a "fixed" set of skills or abilities and instead provided the idea of having a growth mindset towards learning. The article describes the growth mindset in the following way:</p>

      <p><em>"In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it."</em> - <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset">The Habits of Successful People</a></p>

      <p>As a teacher, I can appreciate this viewpoint. I see many kids come into lessons all the time believing that they have set abilities or skills that they are born with and cannot change. As a teenager, I had a similar mentality until I picked up sports and music. Because I was passionate about these things, I spent more time on them, and the more time I spent on these disciplines, the better I became. I realised that if I wanted to become good at anything, persistence, tenacity and reflection were highly important habits to develop.</p>


      <h4>What worked for you? Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
      <p>The idea of meditation (as discussed in <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">What is Meditation and How It Affects Our Brains</a> and <a href="http://www.productivityninja.co.uk/getting-things-done-and-the-mindful-productivity-ninja/">How Mindfulness Can Improve Productivity, Focus and Work Life Balance</a> is one that is I am working on in the habitual sense of doing it regularly enough to have an impact on my learning and productivity. Since reading <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> by <em>Chade-Meng Tan</em>, I have tried to practice more regular bouts of just a few minutes of meditation each day. Especially when feeling frustrated or having to remain focused for long periods of time. This has helped, especially at school when working in a shared office space. This is one time-management and productivity habit that I will continue to experiment with and develop. </p>
