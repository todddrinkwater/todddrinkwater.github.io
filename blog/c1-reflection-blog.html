    <h2>Week 1</h2>

      <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
      <p>The idea of EDA has been a mixture of both excitement and anxiety. The idea that you can gain the knowledge and skills necessary for a junior developer role in just over 4 months is incredible. However, while the workload seems like a mountain to climb. When I first started teaching, I realised how much of my degree was not necessary for my role, and how many key aspects of my career were not covered. EDA's hands-on practical based approach to learning really appeals to me and I hope to get the most out of it.</p>


      <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
      <p>So far my impressions have been really positive. The staff and students are all really friendly, and the work is scaffolded in a way that allows me to quickly progress my skills while reinforcing them. One thing I really love about it is the focus on being highly independent and resourceful. When I don't understand something I am slowly learning the places I can go to for answers, whether it be stackoverflow or my cohorts Slack community.</p>


      <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
      <p>The progressive mindset that EDA promotes is one I identify strongly with. Its inclusive culture is what I try to create within my own classes as a teacher. If everyone feels valued, safe, and included then you tend to get the most out of people and this is what I hope to get here.</p>

      <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
      <p>The preparation material provided to me before the course was great as it gave me some idea of what would be expected in terms of workload and effort. The hardest thing I have found, in this first week, is how much of an impact this has already had on taking care of daily duties such as cooking, washing and all the other fun stuff while trying to dedicate yourself to doing your best in this course.</p>


      <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
      <p>I'm both excited and nervous at the same time. Excited, because I know how much a can learn and grow if I completely dedicate myself to this, but nervous about how well I will stack up to the challenge when the going gets tough later in the program. The one thing that stood out to me in Shareef's Fireside video is to have a kitchen mentality. At the end of the day, it's more up to me, not the teachers and I've been given the tools I need. Let's get cookin'!</p>
