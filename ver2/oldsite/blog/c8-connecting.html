  <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
    <p>
      As a teacher, we would often start the year with a Mihi Whakatau. This was a way for the teacher to acknowledge where they came from, their ancestors and family, and all the things that they identify with as a person. After that, students would get a chance to respond with their own mihi. By doing this, connections were made and this provided a start to a good understanding of each other. Relationships, between the teacher and student, are often considered a key factor in a student's success and well-being while at school.
    </p>

  <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
    <p>
      I found the empathic listening exercise interesting. It was good to practice using empathy with conversation and check how well I usually understand my partner in terms of communicating our feelings. It was also a good reassurance to see that we were both on the same page most of the time. I believe that approaching the conversation thinking "I want this person to be happy" made the listening more genuine and left my partner feeling more open and trustworthy when sharing her thoughts.
    </p>

  <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
    <p>
      Loving kindness meditation I think is a great concept and helps to develop better relationships with people. By acknowledging that others are just like you and wishing for them to be happy - people can sense that you genuinely care about them. This, in turn, provides better understanding between people and therefore better relationships. I enjoyed the exercise in wishing for others to be happy and also felt happier for wishing the same upon people I have had a conflict with in the past.

  <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
    <p>
      <em>The Situation:</em> An argument I had with a member of staff who was in a higher position than me at a school I was teaching at. The argument was over a sports team's attendance to school.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>My perspective:</em> This member of staff was signing off students saying they had at least 80% attendance and therefore allowing them to go to a school sports national tournament. I did not think this was OK, as these students had less than 3% attendance and had already finished school. This was putting other students on the team at a disadvantage as they were losing out on game time, despite putting in hard work to earn their place on the team.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The other perspective:</em>The other perspective I believe was that this was helping to build the school sports team and provide an opportunity for those returning students to get possibly scouted for regional teams. It possibly also could have also given those students a chance to gain more NCEA credits.
