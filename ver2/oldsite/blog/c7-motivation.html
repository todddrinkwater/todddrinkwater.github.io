  <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
  <p>
    The idea of pleasure, passion and purpose and its relationship with motivation is an insight provided by LinkExhange founder Tony Hsieh. Hsieh believes pleasure, passion and purpose all affect levels of motivation in different ways, and with different levels of sustainability.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Pleasure</em></strong> I would most likely compare to a can of soda. It is something that can give a short-term high but then you quickly crash and are left waiting for the next rush. Pleasure is viewed as something that makes you feel really good about what you do, but that level of happiness and motivation is highly unsustainable. One example would be receiving a pay rise. While in the short-term this may increase motivation, this is quickly out-lived and can leave an employee wanting more money in order to seek the same amount of satisfaction from their work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Passion</em></strong> is another name for flow, a term coined psychologist â€ŽMihaly Csikszentmihalyi to describe a feeling of intense focus, enjoyment and engagement when performing an activity. Work that one is skilled in but also finds challenging, often creates the conditions for experiencing flow. When in flow, time can fly by and levels of productivity rise. Compared to pleasure, this is a more sustainable form of motivation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Purpose.</em></strong> Having purpose in your work and life is not only linked to high, sustainable levels of motivation, but also general happiness in one's own life. Purpose is about feeling apart of something bigger than yourself. That means, if you feel your work is meaningful, you will more likely feel more motivated towards it, and in a way that is sustainable.
  </p>
  <h3>Core values</h3>
    <p>
      <strong><em>What are your core values? What do you stand for?</em></strong> The core values I identify with have to do with the betterment of the environment, other people, and oneself. All three of these are interrelated and they both support and rely on, one another. If we take the time to take care of ourselves, we are then more able to assist others and take care of our environment. In saying this, however, it is important we take care of others and our environment as these also play an important part in our health and happiness.
    </p>

  <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
  <p>
    The ideas on resilience I found extremely interesting. The idea that people who were more optimistic tended to be more successful was not surprising. They viewed any setbacks as only short-term and due to isolated, particular circumstances. Pessimistic people, however, often tended to see setbacks are more long-term and due to their own personal inadequacies. What I did find interesting was the research by Barbara Fredrickson. Fredrickson found that negative feelings are essentially three times as powerful as positive ones. Meaning that for every 1 negative feeling we experience, we need 3 positive ones to balance it out! Mindfulness is helpful in this area in two ways. First, by bringing attention to the physiological responses of these feelings, we can learn to acknowledge them, understand the changes that occur in our body, and develop resilience. I found the resilience in meditation exercise helpful for this. Secondly, we can use it to become aware of our own negative bias, and also making sure we pay particular attention to the good moments in our lives. This could even be something as simple as acknowledging being free of pain.
