  <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
  <p>
    The things that cause the biggest emotional responses to me when programming are:
    <ul>
      <li>Being unsure of why a seemingly simple piece of code is not working, and</li>
      <li>Feeling that has been asked of me is not communicated clearly or that I am confused by what I required to do to accomplish a task.</li>
    </ul>
    While I am not one to physically show my emotions often, I can, quietly sit in front of the screen, getting frustrated until the point where I feel blocked.
  </p>
   <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
   <p>
     Working through this exercise helped me to better recognise my bodies response to the emotion and how to better work with it for a more positive outcome. Firstly, I thought about my frustration when stuck on a coding challenge. I then stopped, took some time to breathe (which started to reduce any feelings of anxiety), and began to focus on how my body had felt during that frustration. I noticed a tightness occuring in my muscles (especially in my chest), shallow breathing, and a slight increase in heart rate. Although I would not normally respond with an emotional outburst - I choose to respond by taking more time to focus on my breathing in order to clear my thoughts. This helped me to regain a calmness and  better clarity towards my work.
