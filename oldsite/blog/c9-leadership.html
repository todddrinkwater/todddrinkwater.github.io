  <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
  <p>
    From my experience, those who appear to authentically care about you and what you do are the ones I tended to work harder for. Whether it was a sports term or at work, I would find myself spending more time working for and assisting those who seemed to genuinely care about and understand me. Not only was I willing to give them more time, however, I also was happier in what I was doing and would be more resilient towards overcoming obstacles that got in the way of the task at hand.

   <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
   <p>
     The multiplying goodness meditation was a great exercise in taking the time out to think about others and having good will towards them. I feel that by visualising about finding the good in people and multiplying it, we are challenged to think about the good that exists in everyone. I think this is an important skill for working with others, as it helps us to take the time to empathise more with others even if they do give off negative emotions. This is because of the belief that every has good in them and everyone wants to be happy. If we are willing to understand what is bringing on the negative emotions, we can help to remedy this by listening and genuinely wanting them to be happy.
   </p>

   <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
   <p>
     The tonglen meditation I found particularly difficult compared to many of the previous exercises performed in this book. This was mainly due to the first part of the exercise where we were to imagine ourselves suffering from whatever troubles had been on our mind lately. Because I like to think positively about challenges I have, it didn't necessarily feel good to imagine myself in suffering. I was not used to this, and in some ways it made me feel momentarily worse than I would have been before as it drew on feelings of helplessness. The breathing out goodness part helped to relieve this relatively quickly however and I could find this relatively beneficial if I did ever find myself in any kind of suffering. The part that I did enjoy from this exercise, however, was focusing on taking other people's suffering and returning goodness. It prompted me to stop and think more compassionately about the world, more often.

   <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
   <p>
     The SCARF model strongly relates to my progression as an individual throughout this course so far. Firstly, when having to give feedback to our partners - it posed a possible threat to our status. When doing so, we had to ensure that our feedback is not misinterpreted. To do so, we had considered our partner's identity and how they would most likely interpret the feedback we gave to them. It was important what feedback could help to benefit our partnership and success, and what information may have just been a frustration that may not actually assist anybody in discussing.
   </p>
   <p>
     Throughout our course, there has also been lots of uncertainty. This was generally down to learning lots of new things and being unsure of how well I could cope with learning so much new information at a fast pace. As we began to develop autonomy with the basics of our coding, each week I would begin to become more relaxed and confident with the material from the previous week. This provided a strong sense of accomplishment despite each week becoming more challenging. In regards to relatedness and fairness, it has been great that teachers and peers have all been friendly and easy to work with, meaning that when stuck on a problem our group has been able to assist each other in helping to overcome it.

   <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>

     <strong>The three conservations from my  point of view:</strong>
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li>What happened? Our new flatmate has been constantly blasting heavy metal music from his room while I am at home during the day trying to study.</li>
   <li>What emotions are involved? Frustration. Anger. Awkwardness.</li>
   <li>What does this say about me? I often like the quiet when I am doing work. I am not a big fan of heavy metal. I also quite a few years older than my flatmate. I get frustrated if I feel people are not being considerate of others.</li>
 </ul>

   <strong>The three conservations from his view:</strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>What happened? My flatmate is not a fan of the music I play.</li>
 <li>What emotions are involved? Awkwardness, as I have been playing it loudly for a while and he has only just brought it up with me. Also, because the other flatmates all seem to know each other quite well and I have only just moved in.</li>
 <li>What does this say about me? People may not particularly enjoy the same music or things that I do. I could possibly be seen as someone who is terrible flatmate to the others.</li>
